= FEATURES =

= Active and Passive Reactor support
    Active and passive reactors are supported as well as turbines.

= Multi-Reactor/-Turbine support
    This program allows you to control multiple reactors and turbines at once. You no longer need multiple computers and screens for your large reactor setup. One computer, one screen!

= Inhomogenous Grid support
    You can connect any number of active reactors, passive reactors and turbines to the same controller. It just works.

= Plug&Play
    The controller is fully autonomous and automatically configures, calibrates and estimates optimal values for a reactor or a turbine once it is connected. Just plug it in and you're good.

= Multi-Purpose usage of Active Reactors
    Do you just need a lot of steam for something? Just hook it up to an active reactor controlled by this controller. The controller will automatically regulate the reactors output so you don't run out of steam.

= PD regulation
    In addition to the old turn reactor on/off method, this controller uses a pd regulator to drive reactors and turbines as efficiently as possible while saturating your energy grid.

= Deamon
    Deploy multiple services on the same machine, as the controller itself is a background process and won't block the entire system.

= Headless support
    If you never look at controller screens, you can just remove it once you set up the controller. No screens required.

= Scalable UI
    You like BIG screens? Or maybe ultra wide screens? No problem! The UI scales to fit any screen size you may want.


= HOW TO INSTALL =

  = From MMaster github repo

    Clone the github repo and copy /usr and /etc to your OC system.

  = From original source using installer:

    You'll need a computer with an Internet Card to download Big Reactors Grid Control. Once you've got your computer up and running, run
    
    wget http://xypm.tenyx.de/standalone/brgc_installer.lua
    
    and execute
    
    brgc_installer
    
    If you're upgrading from a previous version, you will need to restart your (in-game) computer now.
    That's it.


= HOW TO SETUP =

    To start the controller you'll have to do:
    
        rc brgc_reactor start
        rc brgc_turbine start
        rc brgc_grid start
    
    Alternatively you can do a simple:
    
    brgcctrl service all start
    
    Don't forget to add brgc_reactor, brgc_turbine and brgc_grid to your /etc/rc.cfg if you want to start the controller at boot time: 

        enabled = { "brgc_reactor", "brgc_turbine", "brgc_grid" }
    
    To do so without editing any files, you may use the following commands:
    
    rc brgc_reactor enable
    rc brgc_turbine enable
    rc brgc_grid enable
    
    You can now connect your reactors and turbines to the computer. If you want to start the gui, simply run
    
    brgc_gui
    
    To use the grid functionality, connect energy storage blocks to your computer using Adapters. Currently EnderIO Capacitors (requires the mod Computronics), Draconic Evolution Energy Storage and RFTools Power Cells are supported.
    
    Note: If you're going to use turbines, also using the grid controller is strongly recommended.
    Note: If you don't intend to use turbines, you can omit starting
    
    brgc_turbine
    
    Note: If you don't want to use the grid controller, you can omit starting
    
    brgc_grid
    
    Note: The controller assumes all active reactors to output steam to the same steam network.
    Note: The controller assumes all turbines to output energy to the same energy grid.
